# About Me

I'm a San Diego-based Security Engineer, with an interest in pretty much all things Cybersecurity.   

Currently, I work for a medical device manufacturer doing detection and response work on the postmarket side of the house.  

I enjoy studying both red and blue team techniques equally, and you'll find blog posts on this site dedicated to exploring both offense and defense.  

Personally, I enjoy spending time with my wife, my two girls and my pug. I like to make time to play video games, trade in the US stock market, and play both basketball and golf.
